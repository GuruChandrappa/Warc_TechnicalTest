# Warc React Technical Test

The test project is a small C# ASP.NET MVC Web application, it is a very simple e-commerce store that sells random products.

You are required to carry out the following upgrades:

1. Add the ability to update the product description by adding a field to the edit page and to the relevant database table.
2. Display the description in the product view page.
2. Replace the current Razor frontend with React ( please do not use ReactJs.net )

Please be sure to do all work in a separate branch.
